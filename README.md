Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) Project using Frankenstein, The Great Gatsby, and The Yellow Wallpaper

- Performed TFIDF on 3 classics literature stories (Frankenstein, The Great Gatsby, and The Yellow Wallpaper) to find the most common words in each story unique to that story
- Explored to discover words with largest TFIDF values are indicative of a story's plot
- Concluded that these words show the focus of the story (feelings, characters, etc), but are not enough to understand a summary of a story
